# Hello-World
My first time coding! Yay! Let's toast to the first day of the rest of my life :)

Hey everyone, thanks for collaborating with me on this!
And by everyone, I mean....myself! lol
Umm, I'm just typing to see what this will look like. I'm excited.

Okay, I'm going to try my first code trick. I'm going to make the word bold actually bold and italicized...
Ready?

_*bold*_
